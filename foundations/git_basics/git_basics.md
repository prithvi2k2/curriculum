### Introduction

In this lesson, we'll cover common Git commands used to manage your projects and to upload your work onto GitHub. We refer to these commands as the **basic Git workflow**. When you're using Git, these are the commands that you'll use 70-80% of the time, so if you can get these down, you'll be more than halfway done mastering Git!


### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

 - Describe how to copy an existing repository from GitHub onto your local machine.
 - Explain the two-stage system that Git uses to save files.
 - Describe how to upload your work to GitHub using Git.
 - Describe how to check the status of your files and how to view your commit history.

### Assignment

Note: As of October 1st, 2020, all new Git repositories will create a default branch named 'main' instead of 'master'.

### Cheatsheet
This is a reference list of the most commonly used Git commands. (You might consider bookmarking this handy page.) Try to familiarize yourself with the commands so that you can eventually remember them all:

* Commands related to a remote repository:
  * `git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git`
  or
  `git clone https://github.com/user-name/repository-name.git`
  * `git push origin main`
* Commands related to workflow:
  * `git add .`
  * `git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"`
* Commands related to checking status or log history
  * `git status`
  * `git log`

The basic Git syntax is `program | action | destination`.

For example,

* `git add .` is read as `git | add | .`, where the period represents everything in the current directory;
* `git commit -m "message"` is read as `git | commit -m | "message"`; and
* `git status` is read as `git | status | (no destination)`.

### Conclusion
You may not feel completely comfortable with Git at this point, which is normal. It's a skill that you will get more comfortable with as you use it. Therefore, we have a project coming right after this lesson where we'll walk you through the entire Git workflow, which is the exact same process you would use in a real project.

The main thing to take away from this lesson is the **basic workflow**. The commands you've learned here are the ones you will be using the most often with Git.

Don't worry if you don't know all the commands yet or if they aren't quite sticking in your memory yet. They will soon be seared into your brain as you use them over and over in future Odin projects.
